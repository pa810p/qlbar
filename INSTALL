===========================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and instlal
QLBar applcation on UNIX (and UNIX-like) system)

It is recommended that you read, or at least skim through, ALL of the
instructions in this file before attempting to build the software.


Making and Installing the QLBar application
-------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the distribution and change directory:

           % tar zxf qlbar-VERSION.tar.gz
     or
           % tar jxf qlbar-VERSION.tar.bz2

     (replacing VERSION with the appropriate version string).  If you
     are reading this file, you probably have already done this!

2.   Type:

           % ./configure --help

     to list available configuration options

     Note also that the configure script uses environmental variables
     for determining compiler/linker options including:

        Variable        Description     Example
        CC              C compiler      gcc
        CFLAGS          C flags         -O -g
        CPPFLAGS        cpp flags       -I/path/include -DFOO=42
        LDFLAGS         ld flags        -L/usr/local/lib
        LIBS            libraries       -llib
        PATH            command path    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

3.   Configure the build system:

           % ./configure [options]

4.   Build the system:

           %  make

5.   Install the software:

          % su root -c 'make install'

6.   Postconfigure system

     a) for single user configuration copy default configuration from package directory 
        into the user directory

          % mkdir $HOME/.qlbar
          % cp ./conf/* $HOME/.qlbar
  
     b) to have default global configuration on system, copy files from conf directory
        to the /etc/qlbar

          % mkdir -p /etc/qlbar
          % cp ./conf/* /etc/qlbar

7.   Edit menu configuration file, to put your own icons on toolbar

          % vim $HOME/.qlbar/menu

8.   Edit design configuration file, to create your own favorit design and placement

          % vim $HOME/.qlbar/config
